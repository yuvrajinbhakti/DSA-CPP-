Approach
1) Reverse the entire string: The solution begins by reversing the entire input string s. This step ensures that words which were at the end of the original string are now at the beginning, and vice versa.

2) Initialize pointers: Three pointers are used: left, right, and i, all initialized to 0. The left and right pointers help in marking the start and end of each word, while i traverses the string.

3) Skip leading spaces: The outer while loop iterates over the string. The inner loop while(i<n && s[i]==' ') i++; skips any leading spaces.

4) Process each word:

Identify word boundaries: Once the leading spaces are skipped, the second inner loop while(i<n && s[i]!=' ') identifies the current word and assigns characters to the correct position in the string starting from right.
Reverse the current word: After identifying the word, it is reversed back to its original order within the reversed string. This reversal is done using the reverse function on the substring from left to right.
Add space after the word: A space is added after the word to separate it from the next word.
5) Resize the string: After all words are processed, the string is resized to remove the trailing space added after the last word.

Reason for the Approach
Efficiency: Reversing the entire string first allows the algorithm to process words in their final position. This avoids the need for additional data structures, making the in-place manipulation of the string possible.

In-place manipulation: This approach modifies the input string directly without requiring extra space, which is memory efficient.

Simplicity: The logic of reversing the entire string and then reversing individual words is straightforward and easy to understand.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
