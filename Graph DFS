Given a connected undirected graph represented by an adjacency list adj, which is a vector of vectors where each adj[i] represents the list of vertices connected to vertex i. Perform a Depth First Traversal (DFS) starting from vertex 0, visiting vertices from left to right as per the adjacency list, and return a list containing the DFS traversal of the graph.

Note: Do traverse in the same order as they are in the adjacency list.

Examples:

Input: adj = [[2,3,1], [0], [0,4], [0], [2]]

Output: [0, 2, 4, 3, 1]
Explanation: Starting from 0, the DFS traversal proceeds as follows: 
Visit 0 → Output: 0 
Visit 2 (the first neighbor of 0) → Output: 0, 2 
Visit 4 (the first neighbor of 2) → Output: 0, 2, 4 
Backtrack to 2, then backtrack to 0, and visit 3 → Output: 0, 2, 4, 3 
Finally, backtrack to 0 and visit 1 → Final Output: 0, 2, 4, 3, 1
Input: adj = [[1, 2], [0, 2], [0, 1, 3, 4], [2], [2]]

Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: Starting from 0, the DFS traversal proceeds as follows: 
Visit 0 → Output: 0 
Visit 1 (the first neighbor of 0) → Output: 0, 1 
Visit 2 (the first neighbor of 1) → Output: 0, 1, 2 
Visit 3 (the first neighbor of 2) → Output: 0, 1, 2, 3 
Backtrack to 2 and visit 4 → Final Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
Constraints:
1 ≤ adj.size() ≤ 104
1 ≤ adj[i][j] ≤ 104

  ans.push_back(node);
//   for(int i=0;i<adj[node].size();i++){
//       if(!vis[adj[node][i]])dfs(adj[node][i],ans,adj,vis);
//   }
for(auto it:adj[node]){
    if(!vis[it]){
        dfs(it,ans,adj,vis);
    }
}
    }

    // Function to return a list containing the DFS traversal of the graph.
    vector<int> dfsOfGraph(vector<vector<int>>& adj) {

    vector<int> vis(adj.size(),0);
        int start = 0;
        // create a list to store dfs
        vector<int> ls; 
        // call dfs for starting node
        dfs(start, ls,adj, vis ); 
        return ls;
