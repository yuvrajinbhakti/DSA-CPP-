Next Greater Element


Given an array arr[] of integers, the task is to find the Next Greater Element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array.
Note: The Next Greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in the array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider the next greater element as -1. 

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 2, 4]
Output: [3, 4, 4, -1]
Explanation: The next larger element to 1 is 3, 3 is 4, 2 is 4 and for 4, since it doesnâ€™t exist, it is -1.


Input: arr[] = [6, 8, 0, 1, 3]
Output: [8, -1, 1, 3, -1]
Explanation: The next larger element to 6 is 8, for 8 there is no larger elements hence it is -1, for 0 it is 1 , for 1 it is 3 and then for 3 there is no larger element on right and hence -1.


Input: arr[] = [50, 40, 30, 10]
Output: [-1, -1, -1, -1]
Explanation: There is no greater element for any of the elements in the array, so all are -1.




class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to find the next greater element for each element of the array.
    vector<int> nextLargerElement(vector<int>& arr) {
  stack<int> st;
int n=arr.size();
vector<int> ans(n,-1);
for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
    while(!st.empty() && st.top()<=arr[i])st.pop();
    if(!st.empty())ans[i]=st.top();
    st.push(arr[i]);
}
return ans;
    }
};
